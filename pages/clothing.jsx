/**
 * METHODS OF FETCHING FROM AN API IN NEXT JS
 * getServerSideProps: This is for server side rendering. What this means is that any code you put here would be executed by the server and not executed by the browser. We would be using getSeverSideProps for this because we want to use SWR(stale-while-revalidate) which is about client side rendering. essentially this is a pattern in NEXT Js that allows the HTTP chache valdation strategy to be done automatically by NEXT Js. This would allow returning of a data if it is cached if it is there and also send a request that would revalidate the data and would come back for an up to date data. After determining the type of fetching you want to use then you would have to do take the following steps. (1) create a .env file in your root folder (2) create a folder in your root folder and name it lib then create an api.js file in it and then make the request. To see a result you would have to restart your server because of the .env file you created.
 * @returns the option used here is getStaticProps. It is useful when the data required to render the page is to be made available at build time ahead of a userâ€™s request and data can come from an headless CMS.
 * another option is to use the fetch API with the useEffect in react.
